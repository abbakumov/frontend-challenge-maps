/**
 * Challenge-related comment:
 *
 * This state part contains ids of currently filtered product items
 * Why not to store just items array? â€“ To have cache in redux store,
 *     but mostly because it's much easier to get IDs in list component
 *     and each product data in item components without searching through all list.
 * 
 * What I would like to add here:
 * 1. Nice fetching status handling with error catching and other
 * 2. Maybe move fetching status to other redux slice to use it for all methods
 * 3. Filters can be moved to other slice as well
